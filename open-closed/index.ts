/**
 * The _Open-Closed_ principle is all about minimizing changes to existing entities when adding new functionality.
 * The entity should be _open for extension_ (think extending a class) and _closed for modification_ (think directly modifying given class).
 *
 * Of course, you can't always extend the entity to implement the necessary changes. Sometimes you will need to change _that_ entity itself,
 * for example when fixing a bug.
 *
 * But, in most cases, we should favour adding new functionality as a separate "lego block" rather than modifying the existing one
